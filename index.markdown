I'm Harrison Glenn, a dedicated student at the University of Sydney with a passion for artificial intelligence, software development, and testing software. When I'm not immersed in my studies, you can find me fueling my adventures with Red Bull, cheering on my favorite Formula 1 teams (red bull), scaling the walls at the climbing gym, or strategizing in competitive Counter-Strike matches. As an enthusiast of Java (and a tolerator of Python), I bring a diverse set of interests and experiences to my work in technology.

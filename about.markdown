## Technical Skills and Expertise

I have gained proficiency in several programming languages and technologies, with a particular affinity for Java. My technical skills include:
- Java
- Python 
- SQL
- R
- React
- Git
- Introduction to Google Cloud courses
- Agile software development methodologies

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices.

## Personal Interests and Motivation

Beyond my love for technology, I find inspiration and joy in various pursuits. When I'm not immersed in coding or studying, you can often find me fueling my adventures with Red Bull, cheering on my favorite Formula 1 teams (especially Red Bull), scaling the walls at the climbing gym, or strategizing in competitive Counter-Strike matches.

These diverse interests and experiences have shaped my perspective and approach to problem-solving. I believe in bringing creativity, determination, and a sense of adventure to everything I do, both in my personal life and in my work in technology.
